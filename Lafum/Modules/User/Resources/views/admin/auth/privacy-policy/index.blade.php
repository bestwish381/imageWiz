          ImageWiz.net may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within

          &nbsp; <br>
          Automatically Collected Information <br>
          Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically 
          collected by ImageWiz.net. This information can include: your IP address, 
          browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This 
          information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the 
          service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the ImageWiz.net 
          website. <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Use of Cookies <br>
          The ImageWiz.net website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online 
          experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web 
          page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
          computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web 
          server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
          save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have 
          returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize ImageWiz.net pages, 
          or register with ImageWiz.net site or services, a cookie helps ImageWiz.net to 
          recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the 
          process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, 
          shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same ImageWiz.net website, 
          the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use 
          the ImageWiz.net features that you customized. <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to 
          decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be 
          able to fully experience the interactive features of the ImageWiz.net services 
          or websites you visit. <br>
          &nbsp; <br>

          This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not 
          responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We 
          encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
          statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

          impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, provided we
